## Welcome!

TETI is a singleplayer, modern block stacker, similar to the likes of Tetra Legends, Tetr.js, Blocks, and other web based stackers.

I hope you enjoy Teti, and if you liked it a star would be appreciated. I want this to grow to a proper maintainable tetris web client, so feel free to contribute, and modify my own code.

#### Backstory
This project started out as a learning experience, because surprisingly it was my first time actually using Javascript. For my high school project (pseudohuman) I wanted to build a multiplayer web based game, and thus I made this to gain experience before starting. I had already programmed in Java, as well as some C# and Python, so I was not unfamiliar to programming, and I already knew frontend basics. Teti was able to combine my interest for tetris, and also challenge me to learn Javascript. After the project was over, I could truly improve the game to make an amazing experience.
