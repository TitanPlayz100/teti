## Desktop App
### NEW!

Releases are now run through a workflow. They are **up to date** and contain all the latest features.

App build using Tauri, feel free to open issues and PRs.

## Data Formats (for my convenience)
### Gamemode Structure (gamemodes.json)
```js
gamemodes = {
    "gamemode_name": {
        settings: {}, // settings that override the default * settings
        displayName: "", // name shown on gamemode selection
        objectiveText: "", // subtext displayed on right side
        goalStat: "", // stat being tracked (valid property in stats class)
        target: "", // target (valid target in settings)
        result: "", // displayed as result (another valid stat in stats class)
        
        // TO BE ADDED LATER
        music: "", // custom song that can play 
        compmusic: "", // custom song that played on pb pace
        startBoard: "", // starting board, tetrio map format
        effects: [], // custom background / effects
    }
}
```

Add functionality mainly in `features/modes.js`.  
You can modify existing modules as well from other files

### Adding Audio (sfxlist.json)
```json
{
    {
        "name": "<name used in code>",
        "path": "assets/sfx/<file path / name>.<ext>"
    }
}
```
Use with `this.game.sounds.playSound(<name>)`
